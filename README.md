## Project Description
Vitilo ThreadTalk is a web-based academic discussion and knowledge exchange platform designed to support structured and meaningful interaction within university courses. The platform provides a dedicated digital space where students can post course-related questions, participate in organized discussions, and collaboratively build understanding through peer and instructor engagement.

The system supports threaded and nested conversations, allowing discussions to evolve naturally while maintaining clarity and context. Each discussion thread is associated with a specific course, ensuring that content remains focused, relevant, and easy to navigate. Students can respond to questions, engage in follow-up discussions, and explore multiple viewpoints within a single structured thread.

A key feature of Vitilo ThreadTalk is the instructor endorsement mechanism, which allows instructors or teaching assistants to formally highlight accurate, high-quality, or authoritative responses. This feature helps students quickly identify trusted answers, reduces confusion caused by conflicting explanations, and improves overall learning efficiency. Endorsed responses also encourage quality participation and knowledge sharing within the academic community.

The platform incorporates role-based access control, distinguishing between students, instructors, and administrators. While students can create and participate in discussions, instructors are empowered with moderation and endorsement capabilities, and administrators manage system configuration, user access, and course-level organization. This structured role model ensures academic integrity, accountability, and smooth platform operation.

Vitilo ThreadTalk is designed with scalability, usability, and maintainability as core software engineering principles. The architecture supports multiple concurrent courses and users, making it suitable for institution-wide deployment. A clean and intuitive user interface minimizes learning overhead, while a modular backend design enables future enhancements such as analytics, search optimization, and integration with existing learning management systems.

Overall, Vitilo ThreadTalk aims to enhance collaborative learning by transforming course discussions into a structured, reliable, and instructor-guided knowledge exchange environment tailored specifically for higher education.
